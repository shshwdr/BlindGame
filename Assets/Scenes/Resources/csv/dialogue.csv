dialogue_3_3,"I lost my left arm, sure. But my right arm grew in strength tenfold!",hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_3_4,But the power comes at a cost. I've hurt many people on accident... even family.,hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_3_5,My life was normal before these Awakening monsters ruined everything. So I'll be dammed if I don't take out each and everyone!,hero1,,,,,,,2,

dialogue_3_9,These goblins are pretty easy. They're too stupid so I can agro them just for standing close.,hero1,,,,,,,1,

dialogue_4_3,"I was doing fine until a snake nearly got the jump on me. Took it down, but not before it gave me a nice parting gift.",hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_4_4,Name’s Kinrick. The quiet one here is Pell. What should we call you?,hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_4_5,Esha. Used to be a blacksmith. Now I put holes in things instead of forging them.,hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_4_6,"Hah, well, that’s a hell of a career change. Awakening’s fault?",hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_4_7,"Took my sense of touch. Can’t feel metal, heat—nothing. Hard to smith when you don’t know if your hands are burning off.",hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_4_8,"Damn. That’s rough. So, why archery?",hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_4_9,"Because my hands might be numb, but my eyes still work. If I have to fight, I'd rather do it from a distance.",hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_4_10,"Fair enough. Pell keeps us alive, I take the hits, you make sure I don’t get overwhelmed. Sound good?",hero1,,,,,,,0,
dialogue_4_11,Works for me. Let’s move.,hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_4_13,"Esha the archer joined your team.She can attack from a distance, making her less likely to get hurt. But she has lower health, so if she does take damage, heal her quickly!",system,,ambOut|dayAmb,,,,,1,

dialogue_5_3,"Yeah, well, I’d rather fight goblins than deal with other monsters.",hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_5_4,Hah. You and me both.,hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_5_5,"Since we have two teammates now, it’s important that you can switch between us.",hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_5_6,"Normally, I’ll be standing closer to you. When Kinrick is directly in line with me, you won’t be able to heal him. Not that I mind.",hero2,,,,,,,0,
dialogue_5_7,"Hey! Ignore her. You can hold the skill key, then press the Up or Down arrow to switch your target.",hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_5_8,"When you switch, you’ll only hear the selected character’s voice clearly—everyone else fades out.",hero1,,,,,,,1,

dialogue_7_5,"Honestly, the stun spell doesn’t seem that useful…",hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_7_6,Wait… what's that sound? Is that… bats?,hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_7_7,I’ve heard they can fire powerful magic orbs. Getting hit by one leaves you halfway through death's door.,hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_7_8,Oh no… Did I just jinx us again? I really need to keep my mouth shut…,hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_7_9,"You sure do! Pell, we’re counting on you!",hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_7_10,"The bats make an annoying screech just before they attack—when you hear it, stun them!",hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_7_11,"And don’t forget, you can switch between targets!",hero1,,ambOut|day2,,1,,startBattle|4,1,
dialogue_8_1,Ha! That was some fight! We actually made it through.,hero1,,ambIn|day2,,,,,1,
dialogue_8_2,"Not bad, Pell. You’re getting faster with those spells.",hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_8_3,"Yeah, but don’t relax just yet… I hear something.",hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_8_4,"Oh no… That’s not just one enemy—it’s all of them. Snakes, goblins… even those cursed bats.",hero2,,,,,,,1,

dialogue_9_6,A dungeon. No doubt about it.,hero2,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_9_7,"I disagree—monsters swarming outside, strange magic in the air... There must be something inside.",hero1,,,,,,,1,
dialogue_9_8,"Something dangerous, I fear.",hero2,,,,,,,1,
